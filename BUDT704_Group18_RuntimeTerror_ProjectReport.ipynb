    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "A major chunk of bank revenue is generated by credit cards. Customers who fail to pay their credit card dues on time could potentially cost banks a lot of revenue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Issuing credit cards to customers who have a higher likelihood of not paying their dues on time involves a higher risk for the bank. Issuing these customers' cards with a higher interest rate would work in favor of the bank. Inorder to make a informed decision about which customer is high risk and which one is low risk, the firm would benefit from a predition model which would accurately predict if the customer would default or not. Prediction can be done based on factors like job, education, balance, loans, and house ownership.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding out which are the most common factors that defaulters have will also help the bank to be cautious before issuing a credit card to customers who fall into one of those categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data for analysis is available from Bank Marketing Data Set for a Portugese Bank in http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has 41188 rows and 21 columns. \n",
    "The variables are divided into 3 categories. The dataset has varibales for bank client data, data related with last contact to customer of the current campaign and social and economic context attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project is highly imbalanced and would require processing such as creating dummies for categorical values, creating bins for some variables, outlier detection and cleaning, and resampling of dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although, the crux of the project is the analysis done to identify the right socio-economic factors affecting defaulting and building a machine learning model to predict defaulters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the data analysis work done for this project: \n",
    "\n",
    "- There are three analysis done to come to a conclusion about which socio-economic factors are important. \n",
    "- For machine learning implementation, it is important to know the correlation between the different variables, this is done using a heat map. \n",
    "- Three machine learning models have been implemented to find the model with the best fit to make a prediction. Out of this one model is presented as the final product for the firm to use inorder to predict defaulters.\n"

    "Customers who are **Married**, work a **blue-collar job** or have a **housing loan** are most likely to default. \n",
    "\n",
    "**54.97%** of defaulted customers are married. Married individuals tend to have a more expensive lifestyle, either due to children or added responsibilities like education, medical treatments. The affairs of family members can easily add financial burden on them.\n",
    " \n",
    "**31.21%** of defaulted customers work a blue-collar job. Blue-collar jobs generally have a lower pay. However, demand for these jobs are most in metropolitan cities where the cost of living is quite high. What's more, the consumption habits of them determined by education level may result in extra entertainment spending on drinking or smoking. They also have high dependence on welfare subsidies which are frequently influenced by policies. These factors foster poor financial conditions for individuals with blue-collar jobs and lead to defaulting. \n",
    "\n",
    "**53.37%** of defaulters have a housing loan. Between customers having a housing loan versus personal loan, customers with housing loan are more likely to default. This can be attributed to the fact that people generally take out a large amount for housing loan as compared to personal loans and large proportion of income goes towards paying the monthly payments. \n"

This is because it takes into account all the relevant metric (such as precision, recall and f1-score) and gives appropriate weights (or importance) to the two classes, because of which it acheived a high score of precision, recall and f1-score. <br> <br>\n",

So, when we tested the model on the oversampled test set, it \"overfit\". "

    "\n",
    "Customers falling under categories with high likelihood of defaulting such as married, working blue-collar jobs or having a housing loan could be offered higher interest rates. This would ensure reduced risks for the firm and greater caution towards these customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "This model can be built into an interface which allows executives to input information about a new customer and would predict in real-time, whether the customer is likely to default on credit card or loan payments. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done by creating a front-end platform (using Django or Flask framework), and hosting it by means of various Platform services like AWS, Azure, GCP, Heroku etc., and then putting all the prediction steps (this includes taking the input data and verifying whether it is correct or not, if correct then scaling the data appropriately and ultimately applying the Random Forest algorithm to get the output) in a \"Pipeline\". Then, we can store this Pipeline as a \"pickle\" file and insert this into our web framework, and then \"containerizng\" it so that the framework cannot be changed, except by the editors. <br>\n"
